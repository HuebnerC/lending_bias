# Overview
In the U.S., systemic racism persists and acts as a barrier to protected classes. One of the most impactful ways to accumulate generational wealth is through home ownership. In this project, I will attempt to create a predictive home loan approval model that accounts for racial bias, if present. 

# Hypothesis Testing 

H_0: Applicants are approved for mortgages at the same rate regardless of race.

H_a: Applicants are approved at a lower rate if their race is not white. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Dataset obtained from FFEIC. 
Interested in 'traditional' home loan approval


# Future Exploration
* Pre-approval rates
* Business loan approval
* Reverse Mortgage approval
