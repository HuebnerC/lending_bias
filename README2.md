# Questions/follow up : 
there is a value for applicant sex: "applicant selected both male and female". This value makes up ~0.05% of the dataset. I'm wondering if this was a way that people indicated on the form that they identify as non-binary, or if it was an accidental button click. 35% of adults in the US identify as nonbinary, so certainly the proportions don't line up. Will keep this in the dataset for now, determine how to interpret later. 

Quicken has a large number of nans for the derived sex, ethnicity, and race columns. Will leave this in as a feature to see if not indicating these affects approvals
